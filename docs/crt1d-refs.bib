	abstract = {A two-stream approximation model of radiative transfer is used to calculate values of hemispheric canopy reflectance in the visible and near-infrared wavelength intervals. Simple leaf models of photosynthesis and stomatal resistance are integrated over leaf orientation and canopy depth to obtain estimates of canopy photosynthesis and bulk stomatal or canopy resistance. The ratio of near-infrared and visible reflectances is predicted to be a near linear indicator of minimum canopy resistance and photosynthetic capacity but a poor predictor of leaf area index or biomass.},

	abstract = {The formulation of a revised land surface parameterization for use within atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) is presented. The model (SiB2) incorporates several significant improvements over the first version of the Simple Biosphere model (SiB) described in Sellers et al. The improvements can be summarized as follows: (i) incorporation of a realistic canopy photosynthesis–conductance model to describe the simultaneous transfer of CO2 and water vapor into and out of the vegetation, respectively; (ii) use of satellite data, as described in a companion paper, Part II, to describe the vegetation phonology; (iii) modification of the hydrological submodel to give better descriptions of baseflows and a more reliable calculation of interlayer exchanges within the soil profile; (iv) incorporation of a “patchy” snowmelt treatment, which prevents rapid thermal and surface reflectance transitions when the area-averaged snow cover is low and decreasing. To accommodate the changes in (i) and (ii) above, the original two-layer vegetation canopy structure of SiB2 has been reduced to a single layer in SiB2. The use of satellite data in SiB2 and the performance of SiB2 when coupled to a GCM are described in the two companion papers, Part II and III.},

	abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of land surface processes and climate-surface albedos, and attempts to bridge the gap between disciplinary studies of atmospheric versus surface climate. The chapter describes physical processes involving the land surface that are of concern to scientists interested in modeling the global climate system. It looks at the physics of land surface albedos by presenting a conceptual basis for understanding the basic concepts. Physical reasoning and simple mathematical models are used to summarize how these factors determine surface albedos. Some of the aspects of surface energy balance considerations that are important for global climate models are summarized. Factors that are important for determining the albedos and energy balance of land surfaces are also outlined. The mathematical theory of plant canopy albedos is presented, and a summary of parameters determining plant canopy albedo is provided. Concepts related to snow albedos, soil albedos, and surface albedos for climate models are discussed. Modeling temperature of a transpiring canopy, and modeling energy exchange over a snow surface are also described.},

	abstract = {The separation of global radiation (Rg) into its direct (Rb) and diffuse constituents (Rg) is important when modeling plant photosynthesis because a high Rd:Rg ratio has been shown to enhance Gross Primary Production (GPP). To include this effect in vegetation models, the plant canopy must be separated into sunlit and shaded leaves. However, because such models are often too intractable and computationally expensive for theoretical or large scale studies, simpler sun-shade approaches are often preferred. A widely used and computationally efficient sun-shade model was developed by Goudriaan (1977) (GOU). However, compared to more complex models, this model's realism is limited by its lack of explicit treatment of radiation scattering.  Here we present a new model based on the GOU model, but which in contrast explicitly simulates radiation scattering by sunlit leaves and the absorption of this radiation by the canopy layers above and below (2-stream approach). Compared to the GOU model our model predicts significantly different profiles of scattered radiation that are in better agreement with measured profiles of downwelling diffuse radiation. With respect to these data our model's performance is equal to a more complex and much slower iterative radiation model while maintaining the simplicity and computational efficiency of the GOU model.},
