    units_long: (m2 leaf) (m2 ground area)-1
    ln: Leaf area index (cumulative)
    intent: in


  clump:
    type: float
    desc: >
      Clump factor $\Omega$. In (0, 1], this parameter represents the impact of leaf
      clumping in space on canopy light transmission and leaf absorption. It can vary

    type: function
    desc: >
      Function used to compute $K_b$ from beam angle ($K_b = K_b(\psi)$).

      It depends on the leaf angle distribution (function) used,
      so it must be passed to the solvers.
    intent: in

    type: float
    desc: The value of the $G$ function for the current solar zenith angle.
    intent: in
    ln: Fractional leaf area in the psi direction


  G_fn:
    type: function
    desc: >
      Function used to compute $G$ from beam angle ($G = G(\psi)$).
      $G = K_b \mu = K_b \cos{\psi}$.
      $G$ is the ratio of leaf area projected in the $\psi$ direction to actual leaf area.
      It is an average over all leaf inclination (and azimuthal) angles
      in the leaf angle distribution.
    intent: in

    type: float
    desc: Mean leaf (inclination) angle.
    units: deg
